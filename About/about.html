        <hr>

        <p id="firstpara">
            We are two passionate students, Koushik Sharma and John Paul Fernandes pursuing our degree in Computer Science, currently working on a Web Technology project that reflects both our technical skills and our commitment to meaningful innovation. Our project, an Event Management System, is designed to simplify how events are discovered, organized, and booked—while also raising awareness about environmental sustainability.
        </p>

        <p id="secondpara">
            With a shared interest in web development and user-centered design, we set out to build a platform that not only streamlines event planning but also promotes eco-conscious gatherings and green initiatives. From intuitive booking features to curated listings of environmentally focused events, our system aims to make participation easier and more impactful.
        </p>

        <p id="thirdpara">
            This project is more than just an academic requirement—it’s a step toward creating digital solutions that serve communities and support causes that matter. We hope our work inspires others to think creatively, act responsibly, and build with purpose.
