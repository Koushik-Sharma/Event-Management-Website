# Event-Management-Website
# Introduction
This project aims to develop an Event Management System that allows users to browse,
book, and manage events online. The platform supports both virtual and in-person events,
providing a seamless interface for event discovery, registration, and feedback. Technologies
used include HTML/CSS for frontend, Java or PHP for backend, and MySQL for database
management. The platform includes user and admin roles, form-based authentication, and
interactive features such as a booking system and event analytics along with an admin panel
through which tasks can be added or removed.

# Rationale
Manual event registration methods are inefficient and prone to mismanagement. This
project digitizes the event process, making it faster, accurate, and more accessible. By
integrating admin analytics and user dashboards, both organizers and participants benefit
from a centralized, real-time system.

# Objectives
1. Provide a clean and informative Home Page with types of events, testimonials, and
reviews.
2. Display Event Listings in card or table format for easy navigation.
3. Enable Event Booking with detailed descriptions and a "Book Now" feature.
4. Create secure and responsive Sign-In/Login functionality.
5. Implement a Contact Us section using embedded maps and contact info.
6. Develop a My Profile page to manage user data and booking history.
7. Build an Admin Panel to manage events and view booking statistics as pie charts
