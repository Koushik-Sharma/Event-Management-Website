# Event-Management-Website
# Introduction
This project aims to develop an Event Management System that allows users to browse,
book, and manage events online. The platform supports both virtual and in-person events,
providing a seamless interface for event discovery, registration, Technologies
used include HTML/CSS for frontend, Javascript and PHP for backend, and Xampp MySQL for database
management. The platform includes user authentication, and
interactive features such as a booking system

# Rationale
Manual event registration methods are inefficient and prone to mismanagement. This
project digitizes the event process, making it faster, accurate, and more accessible. Both organizers and participants benefit
from a centralized, real-time system.

# Objectives
1. Provide a clean and informative Home Page with types of events,
2. Display Event Listings in card or table format for easy navigation.
3. Enable Event Booking with detailed descriptions and a "Book Now" feature.
4. Create secure and responsive Sign-In/Login functionality.
6. Develop a My Account page to manage user data and booking history.
